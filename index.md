<!-- # Hi! -->

Hi! My name is Richard Noh, and I am a 2nd year Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics 
([CSEM](https://oden.utexas.edu/academics/undergraduates/csem-integrated-degree/))
Master's student, graduating May 2025, at the University of Texas at Austin. CSEM is basically an interdisciplinary simulation, 
modeling, and data science degree. I also have two Bachelor degrees: one in Computer Science and the
other in Physics.

While most of my work has been in academic research and study, I am hoping to transition toward applying my specialized knowledge into the industry.

### Current Projects
- Computational modeling research in the Material Point Method with [Dr. Berkin Dortdivanlioglu](https://www.caee.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/dortdivanlioglu).
- Natural language processing research in SLM query rewriting with [Dr. Abhijit Mishra](https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/people/people-details?PersonID=563).
- End-to-end Steam Data Analysis project
