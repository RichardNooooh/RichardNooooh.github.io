<!-- # Hi! -->

Hi! My name is Richard Noh, and I have a 
([CSEM](https://oden.utexas.edu/academics/undergraduates/csem-integrated-degree/)) Master's degree from the University of Texas at Austin, with a background in computer science and physics. I'm especially into backend development, data science, and data engineering - anything that involves building reliable systems around interesting data.

While most of my work experience has been in academic research and study, I am hoping to transition toward applying my specialized knowledge into the industry.

### What am I doing?
- Developing the backend AWS infrastructure in Terraform, Packer, and Github Actions for a Discourse forum business
- Learning vim motions and slowly customizing my [dev environment](https://github.com/RichardNooooh/dotfiles)
- Working on an end-to-end data/ML pipeline for the [EVE online](https://www.eveonline.com) in-game market
